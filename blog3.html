			  	   	    	 			   		<br>4K action camera </h4>
			  									<p>
			 	    GoPro has released their newest action camera, the GoPro Hero 5! And with it another two smaller models the Hero Black and Hero Session.
			 		 <br><br>

			 		The GoPro Hero 5 Black can record footage in 4k (as the Hero 4 could), and includes electronic <strong>image stabilisation</strong>, 2-inch touchscreen, <strong>GPS</strong>, 3 microphones, <strong>voice control</strong> so you can control the camera with your voice e.g. "GoPro start recording" or "GoPro take photo", and is also waterproof till 30 feet without the need of a cover.
			 		<br>
			 		<strong>Battery is </strong>now <strong>not removable</strong>, a downside that might put off a lot of people as it only has up to two hours battery life and you could bring with you another charged battery.
			 		<br><br>
			 		If you want to know the differences between the new models or why action camera would be good for you, just  <a href="/photo" >{{ 'CONTACT' | translate }} </a>

  									<p>
		   You probably have seen already pictures of the new SnapChat (now called Snap) smart sunglasses but what do they actually do?
		   <br><br>
		   The pairs will  sell for $130 and basically they record about <strong>10 seconds of video</strong> (so you would only use it for Snapchat) through their 115-degree-angle lens,  <strong>closer to human eye</strong> than tradicional cameras, and they do it in a <strong>circular angle instead of the usual rectangle</strong>.
		   <br><br>
		  3 colours: Black , teal and coral and suppose to get to the street very soon and then we will see if they are actually useful.
		  <br><br> For now at least they look cool comparing with other smart glasses so at least Snap has managed that.

	   	   	    						<h4><strong> New iPhone 7 Family </strong>
	   	   	    	 			   		<br> What is new? </h4>
	   									<p>
						    This week Apple showcased the new iPhones. So what is new? and how they compare with their older brothers?
							<br><br>
						  <strong> <u>Camera</u></strong>
							<br>
							iPhone 7 Plus has dual camera as the iPhone 6 Plus and maintains the 12 megapixels but now it has dual-lens that allow you to  x2 <strong>zoom without loosing picture quality</strong>.
							<br>
							The <strong>lens are much faster</strong>. The iPhone 7 Plus has a new 6-element f/1.8 lens.Apple says 50% more light gets to the sensor this time around, which will <strong>improve low-light performance</strong>.
							<br>
							Also, it is possible to shoot in RAW mode to edit the photos with more precision on the phone or PC.
		
							<br><br>
						 <strong> <u>Selfie camera</u></strong>
						  <br>
						  The FaceTime camera on both iPhones got better as well. <br>
						   7-megapixel front camera with f/2.2 aperture that has auto <strong>image stabilisation  and does Full HD video recording</strong>
							<br>
							So in terms of cameras it does seem clear that iPhone 7 is <strong>definitely a step up</strong>
							<br><br>
  	    
							<strong><u>Processor and Memory</u></strong><br>
							Better processor and 3GB of memory something that will probably not be noticed but most of the users, only if you do a lot of multitasking and complex task  frequently
					 		<br><br>
					   	   <strong><u> Extras</u></strong>
					   	  	<br>
					 		Water resistant, new mate black finish , a wider  colour gamut screen but same resolution and  new <strong>wireless earphones</strong> (which paradoxically imply the need of buying more cables/adapters). We are not sure anybody should change its iPhone 6 if we take into account these new features.
					 		<br><br>
					 		So basically....in our opinion, the camera is the best improvement of this new iPhone and only people that really likes mobile photography should upgrade  to it :)

	      									<p>
	   			  	    The people from Blocks has had a great idea!  We have seen google fail with modular mobile phones but this smartwatch seems to be succeeding at least for now. More than 5,000 Kickstarter backers pledged more than $1,500,000 to help bring this project to life. <br><br>

	   			  		Most of the smart watches have a set of abilities but with this one you can choose the ones that you actually need as the strap is made of several modules each with their own function. 
	   			  		<br><br>
	   			  		Functions you can choose from include: Camera, extra battery, GPS, heart rate, air quality, fingerprint, Stress level module, NFC payments or a programable button and  more. Plus its open platform is attracting developers that are creating new modules.
	   			  		<br><br>
	   			  		The potential is huge....keep an eye on it. Blocks suppose to start shipping at the end of this year.

   									<p>
   		  	    With all the festivals and picnics that we are enjoying this summer, this new gadget might come handy.
   		  		 <br><br>

   		  		 Xiaomi has created a portable mosquito repeller of a handy size that you can carry with you in all your adventures.
   		  		 <br><br>
   		  			If you are <strong>like to be outdoors and always attracted mosquitos</strong> ...well hopefully you can <strong>repelle them with this</strong>.
   		  			<br><br>
   		  			The device comes with an usb cable and it has to be connected to a portable battery  charger to work. It does take quite a lot of power to keep it working but at a price of less than €10 is a gadget to consider :)

	   	    	 			   		<br> Variable Temperature Kettle</h4>
									<p>
				  	     Today we show a kettle <strong>under  €35  </strong>that is worth noticing.
				  		 <br><br>

				  		If you are a tea passionate this kettle can heat water to the precise temperature you require for brewing various niche teas.
				  		<br>
				  		You can prepare teas and coffees at just the <strong>right temperature </strong>which is great <strong>for delicate teas and French press coffee</strong>.
				  				<br><br>
				  		Cordless with 1.7 litre capacity jug, clear water level gauge and 360° swivel base, features boil dry protection, concealed heating element and removable washable filter with an stylish  brushed stainless steel body.
				  		<br><br>
				  		A few not as positive points to take into account:
				  		<br>
				  		 The kettle always defaults to the 100 degrees setting, it is not easy to see the water through the window to see when filling.
	 
				  		 <br><br>
				  		 Overall <strong>great kettle that will help you safe energy </strong>allowing you to choose the right temperature not wasting energy boiling and waiting for it to cool down.

										<p>
				  	 	    It's difficult to keep up with Xiaomi new gadgets...this week our gadget of the week it's its new action camera  which promises 4k recording. 
				  	 		 <br><br>

				  	 		<strong>Can it compete with a GoPro?</strong> For the moment Xiaomi is already getting a lot of its market and this new model promises to be one force to be reckoned with.
				  	 		<br><br>
				  	 		Comparing with the GoPro Hero4 it even surpasses it in many characteristics like battery (120 min vs 55 min) and of course price, this Xiaomi is less than half price, <strong>definitely a threat </strong>to GoPro :S
				  	 				<br><br>
				  	 		The new Xiaomi Yi II is already in presale in Gearbest.

    						<p>
						Hey <strong>golf players</strong>!! 
						Are you ready to become a better golfer? this gadget might help ;)
						<br><Br>
							It reveals instantly <strong>club speed, club plane, hand plane, backswing position, tempo and hip rotation</strong>...you can review it in a 360 degrees  video from any angle or using the 3D analysis. Sounds good, eh?
							<br><br>
							This is the version 2 that builds on the already solid original Zepp Golf, version 2 is Bluetooth compatible, and offers twice the battery life but the most significant addition this year is the smart coach (that will be available to users of the original Zepp) the intelligent software  will analyze your swing and provide you with a detailed lesson plan and the app will track your progress overtime.
							<br><br>
							Definitely a good one to check out. And would be good for a present too!!

										New version of the Nut tracker is out and comes with improved features so is worth to show this gadget on our 'Gadget of the week' section.
										<br><br>
										First, the design has changed and not longer looks like a tracker, it looks more like a nice keyring or a small decoration item. It comes now with a louder alarm sound which should allow to find objects even faster than before. The battery should last about 8 months and is replaceable, other similar trackers  don't allow it and once the battery is gone then you have to buy another device :S
										<br><br>
										This nut not only lets you <strong>find the gadget attached to it</strong> but it as well lets you <strong>find your phone pressing the nut itself</strong>...so you have two in one ;). More features like warning you when you leave your wallet or mobile behind are there  too.

										 <br><br>
										 A good stylish improved product that might <strong>safe you a lot of nervous/panicky moments</strong>.

									   		   		This is one of the best mugs that we have seen. It keeps <strong> beverages hot or cold</strong> for hours , but really for hours...we are talking <strong>about 8-12 hours</strong> and sometimes the tea is still too hot to drink :S
			<br><br>
			Excellent quality in terms of build and finish and easy to clean. 360ml, so quite big if we compare it with normal mug sizes.
			<br><br>
			Not much to say apart than <strong>works much better than any travel mug that we have tried</strong>.
			<br><br>
									   				Be aware that it might be shipping from Japan..so you can expect delays receiving it.

							   		 We have the miMand 1S and we love it, now Xiaomi has revealed the Xiaomi Band 2 (it is actually the 3rd MiBand from Xiaomi), and adds a new feature that a lot of people was missing in the previous  MiBands. An OLED screen with touch button!!
			
									<strong> You will be able to see the time , steps and heart rate on the Xiaomi band itself </strong>, no need of phone.
									 <br><br>
									 what else is new? It promises more accurate tracking adding an upgraded pedometer algorithm, improved battery (approx 20 days) and wrist band,  and a sedentary reminder.
									 <br><br>

									 As its predecessors it does look very good, actually much better than most of the bulky wristbands from its rivals,  keeps the heart rate monitoring, call notifications and of course....It is still cheap!!

																			<p>
											- Design: We love it! is ergonomic, thin and light (well...light for the size of the battery). We thought the champagne colour will be a bit tacky but now that we have it on our hands.<strong>It looks great!!</strong><br>
											- Usability: It is just easy to use, there are a few things that we don't like about <strong>Xiaomi MIUI system</strong>, but overall great users experience and has many cool extras already installed. The <strong>fingerprint sensor </strong>works perfectly and is very handy to seemly unlock the phone.<br>
											- Screen: It's just amazing! Inside of the house or outside, for movies or gaming...You could compare it with mobiles much more expensive and this would be better. Plus has fallen a few times and no scratches at all!<br>
											- Price: It would be difficult to find a more complete phone for this price

											<br><br>
											<strong>Cons</strong>
											<br>
											- Camera. The camera is not bad. Actually is pretty good, except on low light where it is just not good enough. Panoramic mode is useless too as it changes the resolution and looses all the detail. The front camera for selfies is pretty good, so overall a so so camera<br>
											- The build: The build is very good and its metallic cover will last long, but the golden ribbon of the screen is made of plastic/cardboard so if it falls without a cover, that little ribbon will get damage and look pretty bad.
											<br><br>
											<strong>The rest</strong>
											<br>
											Battery is ok , it last up to 3 days but for heavy use will last about a day. It has quick charge so with 5 minutes you get half day.
											<br>
											Sound is good too no complaints.
											<br>
											Connectivity is good too , no problems with 3G, 4G, bluetooth, WIFI or GPS 
											<br>
											<strong>Does not have USB-C or NFC</strong> which would be nice to have but overall a very good terminal for the price.
											<br><br>
											If you don't know what mobile is right for you, just <a href="http://www.yourtechshoppers.com/computing">contact us</a>, we will find the best for you!

								   				What would you say if we tell you that you can alter the sound of the world around you? in the office, metro,  concerts... that you can actually adjust the hearing to your liking.
												<br><br>
												These wireless bluetooth earbuds from Doppler labs are trying to give us a bit of a <strong>superhero hearing ability</strong>. We have been listening of VR (virtual reality) for a while but we never got options when we talk about the hearing sense.
												<br><br>
												These earbuds adjust, via an app, the volumes of particular sounds around you.
												<br>
												For example. Do you want to change the volume of the TV without afecting the rest of the people watching? Avoid the noise in a busy restaurant when you are having dinner with your girlfriend/boyfriend (that might not be a good scenario)? Or eliminate the noise in the metro or even the office, replacing it with white noise, so you can concentrate? These earbuds mean to do all these things. You can even play with the bass, mid-range and treble tones when you are in a concert or listening your favorite music. 
												<br><br>
												As an idea it actually sounds amazing! An reviews have been giving praise to this innovative product that was available in Kikstarter 
												for $199.
												<br><br>
												Today we are in a park writing and listening to the sound of the birds, and we are enjoying it, but we can think of a handful of situations where we would like to have these earbuds at hand...definitely a product to watch!!

									   				New MacBooks are out! So what is new:
													<br>
													New colour - <strong>Rose gold </strong>
													<br>
													Battery -  <strong>Up to 10h </strong>battery life
													<br>
													<strong>Improved graphics</strong>
													<br>
													<strong>Faster performance</strong>
													<br>
													<strong>Low resolution webCam</strong>. Seriously Apple? in a > €1000 laptop? 
													<br> <br> 
													And as the predecessor...<strong>only one port</strong>, a USB-C . Yes, still only one port so no plugging cameras, monitors or flash drives at the same time you charging your Macbook - Apple seems to be designing more and more for wireless users but they should give us at least one more port please :)
													<br>
													Super thing and light. Design as always gorgeous and the price....well...as always expensive.
													<br>
													To be honest the new MacBook features are not extraordinary but as always the design is just class!!  
													<br>
													If you don't know what laptop is the best for you. You can <a href="/computing">contact us ;)</a>

										   				If you already have a good sound system at home but you want a bluetooth speaker to just use on your bedroom or for when you travel or go to the park. We <span class="fi-heart"style="font-size:15	px;"></span> this one! Anker is  a good brand and hasn't disappoint us  yet. 
														<br><br>
														This is a powerful bass rich speaker for the size and prize. You can take a closer look on the video above
														<br><br>
														<strong>Pros: </strong>Sound, volume , bass,  excellent portable size and affordable.
														<br>
														<strong>Cons:</strong> Battery Life is about 4 hours. No display for battery left. Bass in low volumes. We still don't understand the led lights :S
														<br><br>
				
														Overall, we highly recommend it ...<strong> if you compared with a Bose you won't see much difference, apart from the price</strong> ;)
					
														<br><br><br>
												FYI. The meaning of the leds: 
												 Pairing: Flashing blue 
												-  Working: Steady blue
												- Battery Low: Flashing red
												- Charging: Steady yellow power indicator
											    -  Fully charged: Power indicator goes off
											    -  Power off: Off<br>
												well...most of the time, sometimes is charging and flashes yellow power indicator for us

   			   				This is one of the best gadgets that we have in our kitchen :)  We love it!
   							<br><br>
   							It's a blender with  a portable sport bottle which means after you prepare your favorite smoothy you have it ready to go! 
   							<br><br>
   							Just pour the ingredients into the bottle, use the button  for half a minute or so to blend the ingredients and you have it. The bottle is very ergonomic, easy to clean and durable , it has been with us for a year now.
   							<br><br>
   						 	It is a powerful machine it even crushes ice. It has been handy to make mojitos too ;)
   							<br><br>
   							You have several options on the bottles size. We have the 600ml and it is just right for one person. Great present for a sporty/healthy friend :)

														<p>
		   				 Electric skateboards are starting to be  "a thing" and a lot of models are appearing lately, well, the Blink Board is the lightest electric skateboard yet and the cheapest too $499. So it is worth to take a look at its features:
		   				 <br>
		   		 with about <strong>4Kg </strong>(9lb), it can drive till <strong> 9,5 km </strong>(6 miles) with a full charge, the max speed is 15Mph and the <strong>charge time is 1 hour</strong>. It is controlled with a remote control (two speed modes) or with the phone. The board is also equipped with some LED accent lights, trying to make it cool and safer :) , it doesn't sound bad at all.
		   		 <br><br>
		   		 For short distances could work, and it seems more manageable than its competitors which are very heavy and long! <br><br>See it in action on the video above

			   Home projector  that you can easily transport anywhere? Furthermore, a projector that you can even use as a personal computer? please give it to us :)
			   <br><br>
			   We know Doogee mostly for their cheap but quality smartphones. This is their first projector, that we are aware of, but we are very excited about it.
			   <br><br>
			   With a native resolution 854x480 pixels that should provide enough display quality for basic use. USB, micro USB,  1GB RAM + 8GB ROM . Wifi and Bluetooth to allow you to connect your laptop/smartphone. Miracast , airplay and DLNA Wifi for wireless photo , video , music transfer and supporting sync screen technology that you can use for gaming....it seems like a very complete pocket projector.
			   <br><br>
			   The battery should last about 3 hours (4800mAh battery) and the device can be used as a power bank.
			   <br><br>
			   The design is cool (it's tiny - 250gr)  and the price is smashing :) !!
			<br><br> If you have a plain white wall on your house ...you should definitely give it a try, we will do!

		 Looking for a present for your parents? This Sunday is <strong>mother's day </strong>in Uk and Ireland, the 19th of March is <strong>father's day</strong> in Spain so you might be asking yourself... What should I buy for them? 
		<br><br>
	     This is one of the gadgets that we are going to buy as a present :) because in our families we looooove wine.
		 <br><br>
		 This wine preserver claims to improve the 3 days storage of any wine to <strong>3 weeks after being opened</strong>, you can use it for several bottels of wine  (it comes with two stoppers) and its temperature sensor will work on Fahrenheit and Celsius
		 <br><br>
		 You can easily charge it via USB and it  looks good  too :)
		<br><br>
		Fair enough, most of the time we finish our bottels of wine with no problem, but for those times when we can't have more or for that cooking wine that you don't use that often...here you have the answer as a novelty gift

				 New Xiaomi Mi5 has arrived and has come with no many surprises but with very good specifications and a very elegant design.
				<br><br>
	      	    Snapdragon 820 an until  128GB, the terminal grows until the 5,15 inches. You can find it with 3GB or 4GB of RAM. Options: </strong>
		
				<br>
				<strong>Standard edition: </strong>32GB and 3GB  RAM, 1,8GHz processor<br>
				<strong>High edition:</strong> 64GB and 3GB  RAM, 2,15GHz processor<br>
				<strong>Ceramic exclusive:</strong>  128GB and 4GB de RAM, 2,15GHz processor<br><br>
		
		
				4G and NFC support, front fingerprint sensor and USB-Type C with quick charge
				<br><br>
				mi 5 is about 129 g and has a battery of 3.000mAh which is not massive but that is why is so light and thin
				<br><br>
				Overall a great addition to the list of options that we have for flagship phones at a good price. Actually it already has more than 16 millions of reservations so Xiaomi seems like is going to do OK this year.
				<br><br>
				Above you have a summary of Xiaomi's MI5 MWC 2016 presentation.

	 				We know Dji for its drones but today we are going to talk about the DJI Osmo camera. Dji has brought all their drones work in camera stabilisation down to the ground and into your hands
				
	 				<br><br>
		      	    Yes, there are better cameras, but we would struggle to get the quality of this  one at the same price. <strong>With until 4k video recording it is one to watch</strong>
				
					<br><br>
				
					An attachment allows you to connect your smartphone to it, which enables you to use it as a monitor to view a live image (via Wi-Fi) from the camera
					<br><br>
					The microphone seems to be the biggest flaw but depending of what use you are going to give to the camera, it might not bother you that much. With 6-hour standby time
					and 1 hour of video shooting, you might want to have an extra battery but apart from that, the accessories included seem pretty decent.
					<br><br>
					We like it!

			   	 	   	The 1byOne is a very cool turntable with an exquisite design. It is light enough and the handle makes it easy to carry so you can bring it to any party and it offers an ok sound for the price that we are talking about <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00XVJLYPW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00XVJLYPW&linkCode=as2&tag=yourtechshopp-21">€85</a>
			


			   			<br><br>
			   			With RCA and headphone jack outputs, you can enjoy the music of vinyl records at your own speaker system and headphones.  The best of this device is not the sound though, this is what we will call a turntable for beginners. <strong>This gadget focuses on its design  ;) it just looks great</strong>, plus if you haven't had a turntable before there is something about  letting that needle touch the vinyl that you can not find in any Hi-Fi system that everybody should experiment.
			   			<br> you might not be able to get a combination of design and sound for this price better than the 1ByOne that is why we think is a good present

	This new wearable Thermometer "<strong>monitors Body Temperature, Posture, and Motion</strong> of Your Loved Ones. All Day… All Night…" and we think it could be very useful in many cases.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Its campaign focuses on the monitoring of babys and elderly people. This device not only alerts you when the temperature has passed an specific umbral, it tells you as well if the person is awake/asleep as monitors motion and position too, so you can go to sleep and relax knowing that <strong>Check-my-term will alert you if something goes wrong</strong>.
	<br><br>
	It  comes, obviously,with an app and allows you to share information with your doctor too. The app has a 'Record Symptoms' section where you can select symptoms from a menu and add additional notes to complete these reports. Check-My-Temp claims 30 days continuously monitoring without charging which is more of what we are used to... with wearables.
	<br><Br>
		A few more features of the app make this a very complete package for controlling temperature and more. It has achieve  its goal in Indiegogo and shipping is expected to begin this July.

 	Are you tired of charging your phone everyday or even every half day? It seems like the smartphones gave us a lot of new features but have gone backwards on the battery side of things.
 	<Br><br>
 	Oukitel tries to solve that problem and promises <strong>between 10 and 15 days of normal use without charging</strong>. The downsite of this is that with that battery you can't expect a light smartphone.
 		<br><br>
 		 If you are  a person that travels and does not want to be worried about charging the phone, this could be a phone that suits you, the other characteristics are ok and the price is not bad at all (€188)
 		<br> <br>
 		Another option for great battery is the already in preorder  the  <a href=http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_218002.html  target="_blank" >Ulefone Power </a> that you can find in Gearbest too which would last about <strong>4 days normal use </strong>and has even better specs in other areas.

	   	     	   <p>
	 We have talked before about the new Amazon Kindle family. Today we talk a bit more about the Kindle 7 inch that has erupted on the tablets low cost market. Here are the pros and cons of our time with the cheapest of the kindle family 

  
	  <br><br>
	<strong>The Pros</strong>: Price - It does well the basics - Strong - Premium members tailored operating systems

	  <br>
	 <strong> The Cons</strong>: Takes long time to charge - It won't be good enough for techies (neither other at this price) -  No HD - It doesn't have access to all of the Android apps in the Google Play Store - Amazon ads (to get rid of them £10) 

 
	  <br><br>
	    Overall <strong>for the price</strong> we think is a good gadget for people that will use it to browse the internet, emails or basic games.
		<br><br>
		Good present for parents non techies or kids that  won't need much from it. We have given one to one of our family members and she is delighted :)
		<br> <br>
		Any question about the performance of this gadget, you know you can ask us ;)

     	     	<h4><strong> Sennheiser CX 275s</strong>
     	   		 <br>
     	   			Universal Headset
     	   		</h4>
     	   <p>
 Sennheiser is one of the best sound quality brands that you can find and these earphones are at the level of a quality speaker system specifically designed for smartphones.
  
  <br><br>
  You don't only get powerfull earphones, you get as well a microphone and call pickup/cancel button that you can use in most smartphone/tables, not volume button though :( . The microphone is good and the person of the other end can hear you without any trouble.

  <br><br>
 The design is pretty basic following Senneheiser aesthetic and the ear tips (3 different sizes) are confortable and provide isolation to external sounds.
 
  <br><br>
   These earphones are bass driven, the bass is the focus, for bass lovers that want a integrated mic these are earphones to watch, if you are not that much into bass you might find that it misses other ranges of the spectrum but overall and for the budget we can recommend them

	  		  Xiaomi new MiBand is here and includes an optical heart monitor and all for approx. €30. 
		  
	  		  <br><br>
	  		  Xiaomi MiBand is one the most popular wearables in the world and this new version adds heart rate monitoring and the possibility to unlock the phone when approaching MiBand to it to its previous  sleep and step counter.
		   
	  		  <br><br>
	  		  The dimensions are a bit different than the previous model so you can not use the same accessories but they are cheap enough.
		 
	  		  <br><br>
	  		  Available to order  in Bestgear, unfortunately is not available from the European warehouse at the moment and has to be shipped from China so  it won't  arrive for  Christmas... still is a good one to have for our  new year resolution of doing more exercise ;)

	     	   <p>
	  		  This week another educational toy because we want to give for Christmas the perfect  gift that makes your kids the best inventors.
		  
	  		   <br><br>
		
	  		Makey Makey is trying to "help people start to think of themselves as Makers and agents of change. When you have the <em>Maker's Mindset</em>, you know you can change the world."
	  		  <br><br>
	  		Basically it works like a keyboard/mouse message each time that you touch an element connected to Makey Makey (18 Inputs, 12 Keyboard, 6 Mouse). The best part  is that you can use different objects to do these actions, which awakes your creativity. Any material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity should work E.g. Bananas, iron,  clay , lemons...
		  
	  		  <br><br>
	  		<strong> Have fun, think, invent and MAKE.</strong>The possibilities are endless!

	   	   			Cast your music to your Speakers
	   	   		</h4>
	   	   <p>
	   			This gadget solves a problem that  a lot of people have...and it's one of those that just works, simple and great!
	   			    <br><br>
	        	 	If you have a good soundsystem at home, you probably don't want to buy a cheap bad quality bluethooth speaker to just stream the songs  from your phone :)
	   		<br><br>
	   			 Chromecast allows you to stream music through your speakers without cables, and not only that , it makes it sound so much better that when you play it connecting you phone to your speaker via the jack or bluetooth. Chromecast plays the music from the cloud not from the device, so no matter how bad  your smartphone sound is...if you have good speakers, the music will still sound great on them.
	   			<br><br>
			
	   			When you Chromecast is connected you can still use your phone to get a phone call something that we couldn't do when we have our phone connected via the jack to our speakers. You can also allow casting from devices not signed into your Wi-Fi network via a PIN-based guest mode, to allow your guest choose the music and create great atmosphere for the best party ever :) !!
	   			<br><br>
	   		a few things that you have to consider:
		  
	   		  <br>
	   		  - You don't have to connect your phone/tablet  to your speaker with cables but you do have to plug the Chromecast into an outlet for power.
	   		    <br><br>
	   		    - It streams from the cloud so you can use it for soundcloud, spotify etc.. If you're using an app that doesn't have native Chromecast support, technically you can opt to mirror all of the audio coming out of your mobile device or your computer's Web browser and cast that to a speaker instead but we haven't tested this feature.
	   		  <br><br>
	   		  - At the moment you can not cast to multiple Chromecast audio but...this feature is coming!! and we are very excited about this. Full house sound system control at your fingertips with a few old hifi speakers.
	    <br><br>
	   		  It was exactly what we needed to make the house fully soooooound. We love it!

	   <p>
		Most of us like our fancy watches and change them depending of our outfit or event. The wearable industry is trying to convince us that the smart watches can be cool too...but the offer is not the same and in general smart watches lack a slick design.
		    <br><br>
   	      Chronos can be the solution as <strong>it brings the best of smart watches to our loved "dumb" watches</strong>.		
		 <br><br>
		With Chronos you can get <strong>smart notifications, fitness tracking and  control </strong>your phone's volume, music and camera through personalised taps and <strong>gestures</strong>.
		 <br><br>
		  Chronos specifications say the battery last 36 hours on full charge and it takes about 30 mins to charge. It measures under 3mm thin and 33mm in diameter so as per Chronos website it should fit on over 80% of watches sold today.
		<br><br>
	  Can our  watches get smarter? Yeeeeeeeeeeees

	  Chinese gadget Xiaomi is known for creating cheap but good products and MiScale is not exception.
	    <br><br>
	      MiScale is an elegant digital scale that shows your weight in pounds or kilos with its 161 LEDs display. 

	 <br><br>
	 so...why is it  smart? you can connect it with your smartphone ( app Mi Fit) and it will record your weight/BMI changes, actually not only yours, <strong>it can manage the weight of up to 16 people</strong> which recognises individually when they step on the scale...and 16 is probably enough for the whole family and neighbours  ;)
	 
	 <br><br>
	 It's powered by 4xAA batteries and works with  bluetooth 4.0,android and iOS (check compatibility), it can weight from 0.05 to 150kg and its white glass platform and style make it a scale that would look very good on the bathroom of any house.

	  Heads up ...you are driving!
	    <br><br>
     Hudway turns your smart phone into a head-up display at an affordable price.
	   <br><br>
	   Hudway has a number of apps that use your phone's GPS and accelerometer to show you data like location, driving speed and directions while you are driving. Plus, Hudway app doesn't visually overwhelm you with a lot of data. It is thought to keep you safe and don't distract you
	 <br><br>
	 There seems to be some limit on the display if you are directly facing the sun but in places like Ireland and UK that actually doesn't matter that much ;)
	 <br><br>

      There are better options out there but for the price we think this gadget is one that you should consider if you are looking for a new lamp desk.
	   <br><br>
	  <strong> The best:</strong> 3-Level lighting, High quality long lasting LEDs, night light mode and  1-hour auto-off timer saves on electricity.
	  
	<br>
	<strong>Not so good: </strong>It's basic, it has less light levels than other options of the same price range but it seems to be more reliable.

	Overall a cheap, nice eco-friendly lamp. If you want to safe energy and don't want to be changing bulbs for a while ;) ... this could be your option

  						     		The new iMacs are in the stores now. And with them  retina 4K display for 21.5 macs :) at an "affordable" price.
  										5k retina display comes with all the 27 inches now and the new improved Magic mouse  2 and Magic Keyboard are the default option in all models. This new magic devices fully charged battery should last about a month and it looks like Apple has really though about comfort when designing them. 
  									<br><br>
  									Not so good: Fusion drive or flash storage are not the default option and can not be upgraded later, same as the RAM, so please make sure you get the adequate ones for you when configuring it, if you are thinking in buying one... You know you can always ask us for advice on these things ;).
  									<br>
  									The iMac 21,5 with 4k resolution got a 1 out of 10 (higher easier to repair..) in  <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iMac+Intel+21.5-Inch+Retina+4K+Display+Teardown/51098?">iFixit </a>, definitely not a good score. Basically it is difficult to repair so it will be expensive to do so.
  									<br><br>
  									Overall still one of the best one in all computers in the market in our opinion and the retina display make them even better.

						     			Rugby world cup is on and we wanted to show a gadget that could fit into this season....so we show you a ball. Yeah, we know it's actually an American football ball....but they are pretty similar ;), plus this is not only a ball, it is a speaker too!!
						   				<br><br>
									<strong>Nice features:</strong>  Waterproof and it floats. Beach friendly. glows-in-the-dark. It can be used as charger. Long bluetooth range. high impact (it has been tested with a drop from a several-story-up balcony  which it survived)
									 <br><br>
									It's a bit pricey but for beach lovers, party seekers and football/rugby fans might worth a try.
			
									<br><br>
									No much time left for its kickstarter campaign to finish and they are not close to their $75,000 target. So, if you are interested in this fun gadget. Back them  before is too late:)

	  						  <br>
	  			  			  <br>
	  						 <strong> The best: </strong>It contains the basics for a tablet, all compacted in a gadget supplied for a well respected brand.
	  						  <br>
	  						  <br>
	  						  <strong>The worst: </strong>It is Amazon content focused (which might be a good thing for Amazon lovers) and it contains sponsored screen-savers (to get rid of them  the price increases  £10 )
	  						  <br><br>
	  						 This is something that we don't like, if  they're going to include ads , they should give it to us for free ;). It makes more sense to us now why the price is so low. It will compensate Amazon at the end, as it will most likely drive more sales towards them (good strategy).
	  						  <br>
	  						  Anyhow, a good gadget for the price. Maybe you even like the sponsored screen-savers, we believe they have good stuff planned for us.

  			Start doing things<strong> at the touch of a button</strong>...because we are too lazy to swipe and tap our  smartphone touchscreen anymore and we want to GO BACK TO BUTTONS :)
			<br><br>
			Flic is a wireless “smart button” that can connect to your phone to perform a wide variety of tasks. Each Flic can execute three actions by clicking,   double-clicking and yet another by holding. It comes with a reusable double-sided washable adhesive so you can stick it anywhere
  			  <br>
  			  <br>
			  
  	         Things that you can do with Flic: control lights, play music , take a picture, navigate , order pizza and much more. 
			 <br>One of the features we think is one of the most important.Flic lets you <strong>send a distress signal</strong>. E.g. send a text message to your friends with your location if you feel in danger without nobody realising it.
			   <br><br>
			Flic  team claims the <strong>battery will last up to five years</strong> and is a standard coin battery that can be replaced. 
			<br><br>
			I just wished they had it in red....I have big plans for the red button (diabolic laugh)

	  	          How much time do you spend in the morning trying to find your keys, phone , etc ? Most of us have that problem.

				   <br><br>
				   The bad...the battery only last about a year so you have to keep buying them, so  $25  a year to find your keys its a bit pricy.

		   	   		  		New Photography Experiences
		   	   		  			</h4>
		   	   					<p>
	     	 Why are these cameras different? They capture "the entire light field – all the rays of light traveling in every direction through a scene – instead of a flat 2D image" so you don't need to pick a single focal point. You  can take a picture and you can leave to your friends to  interactively refocus and play with perspective shifting in your posts, which could be very cool addition to your blog.
	        			   <br><br>
	      			    You have to learn  how to get the best of this gadget. You can not trust what you have learn about taking pictures, in order to create those beautiful "living pictures" you have to see the light ;)... but if you are looking for new photography experiences and you have the money (it's price is one of its flaws) could definetly worth a try.

	   	   		  			</h4>
	   	   					<p>
	  		    Most of us use now multiple navigation apps in our phone to guide us when driving and, if you don't have a copilot, this phone holder for car air vent could be a good gadget for you .
	  			  <br>
	  			  <br>
			  
	  		With an easy one hand operation you can put your phone in any position you want, including portrait and landscape positions or anything in between which doesn't happen with other phone holders 
	  				<br><br>
	  				The design is good and will not interfere with the aesthetic of your car as it won't be visible once the phone is attached to it.
	  			   <br><br>
				    This might not be the best option for you, thought, as it will depend on where your air vents are situated and if you  get good and clear visibility from the driver sit. But if that is the case, and you have perfect vision....this is one of the best and simple options that we have seen.

		  We are still on the holidays season, so we wanted to show you something that helps make a bit easier the travel to your, I'm sure, gorgeous destination....or your camping trip.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
	 This travel jacket with built-in neck pillow, eye mask, gloves, drink pocket etc should help you. It comes in 4 Styles : Sweatshirt,  windbreaker,  bomber jacket or  blazer and it has pockets designed for tech, including spots for earbuds and a phone, but also for a tablet.

			<br><br>
			 Baubax is close to  the $5 million figure in kickstarter which is an incredible number for a clothing project (and for any kind of crowdfunding project). Yes, we know that is not strictly speaking "technology" but we believe could help store your gadgets on those long plain/train trips.
				 <br>
			 We hope when we store all our gadgets on the Baubax jacket, we can still walk and look cool ;)

		  			  <br>
		  		The wine purifier
		  			</h4>
					<p>
	  		  
	 "Üllo purifies any wine, restoring it to its natural state."
	  <br><br> 
	 There are a lot of people sensitive to sulfites but these preservatives are needed to  properly store it. Üllo claims to fix this problem and return the wine to its natural state, removing "sulfites, sediment, and second thoughts". 
			<br> <br>
  			This gadget has definetly caught our attention. For $60 if you are or you know somebody sensitive to sulfites, might be a good one to pre order before it gets more expensive. The basic order comes with 5 filters.
			The anticipated retail price for ten sulfite filters is $20 (Üllo is still determining the final filter specifications, but their research indicates that filters maintain efficacy for at least six months)
			<br><br>
			 We can't put price to enjoy a good wine without worries! We wish them the best of luck.

		  			  <br>
		  		Best pet ever!!
		  			</h4>
					<p>
	  		  
			  We believe Lily could be one of the fanciest and cutes drones for  sport and/or photography  passionate early adopters.<!-- and at a reasonable price.  -->
			  <br><br> 
			   Nobody needs to control it. It's simple, it follows you "throw and go!" 
		  		<br><br>
		  			 If this beauty does everything as shown in its promotional video above, it would be a really interesting drone.
		  			<br><br>
		  			Lily records video in full HD 1080p / 720p at 60fps (SloMo is 120 fps) and takes 12MP still photographs. Should fit in a backpack, is waterproof and can even land in water.
					<br> <br>
		  			The bad, only 20min battery life is a bit low :( but it  will be enough to record a nice round of skating, rafting or even all your movements on your soccer training (2h to recharge). The other one , it does not include obstacle avoidance, so it should be kept in open spaces.
					<br><br>
					Our team has already pre-ordered one. Hopefully we can do a full review soon.

              <p>
				  Tired of dull toys for your kids? Sphero  is a next generation toy , kids can play with it and at the same time THEY LEARN!
				  <br>
				  A good mix of technology and robotics. You will be introducing your kids to science without even realizing it.
				  <br>
				  Furthermore Sphero can actually teach programming as it's itself programmable. We like it!!!
				  <br>
				  Less barbies more robots :)
