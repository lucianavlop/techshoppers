  						     		The new iMacs are in the stores now. And with them  retina 4K display for 21.5 macs :) at an "affordable" price.
  										5k retina display comes with all the 27 inches now and the new improved Magic mouse  2 and Magic Keyboard are the default option in all models. This new magic devices fully charged battery should last about a month and it looks like Apple has really though about comfort when designing them. 
  									<br><br>
  									Not so good: Fusion drive or flash storage are not the default option and can not be upgraded later, same as the RAM, so please make sure you get the adequate ones for you when configuring it, if you are thinking in buying one... You know you can always ask us for advice on these things ;).
  									<br>
  									The iMac 21,5 with 4k resolution got a 1 out of 10 (higher easier to repair..) in  <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iMac+Intel+21.5-Inch+Retina+4K+Display+Teardown/51098?">iFixit </a>, definitely not a good score. Basically it is difficult to repair so it will be expensive to do so.
  									<br><br>
  									Overall still one of the best one in all computers in the market in our opinion and the retina display make them even better.

						     			Rugby world cup is on and we wanted to show a gadget that could fit into this season....so we show you a ball. Yeah, we know it's actually an American football ball....but they are pretty similar ;), plus this is not only a ball, it is a speaker too!!
						   				<br><br>
									<strong>Nice features:</strong>  Waterproof and it floats. Beach friendly. glows-in-the-dark. It can be used as charger. Long bluetooth range. high impact (it has been tested with a drop from a several-story-up balcony  which it survived)
									 <br><br>
									It's a bit pricey but for beach lovers, party seekers and football/rugby fans might worth a try.
			
									<br><br>
									No much time left for its kickstarter campaign to finish and they are not close to their $75,000 target. So, if you are interested in this fun gadget. Back them  before is too late:)

			  			   			 so...what does it do? and why does Apple want to be a part of it? 
			  			   			 <br>
			  			   			 Drop helps you  measure ingredients like a normal scale but, your moves are followed very closely by an iPad app (only for iPad). Let's say you don't have enough of an ingredient for the desire recipe....Drop adjust measurements on the other ingredients or offers substitutions so your cookies are still yummy!

	  			 tablet <strong>is only £50</strong> !! This is an amazing price for what it offers and it's definitely a competitor on the  low-cost tablets market.
  
	  						  <br>
	  			  			  <br>
	  						 <strong> The best: </strong>It contains the basics for a tablet, all compacted in a gadget supplied for a well respected brand.
	  						  <br>
	  						  <br>
	  						  <strong>The worst: </strong>It is Amazon content focused (which might be a good thing for Amazon lovers) and it contains sponsored screen-savers (to get rid of them  the price increases  £10 )
	  						  <br><br>
	  						 This is something that we don't like, if  they're going to include ads , they should give it to us for free ;). It makes more sense to us now why the price is so low. It will compensate Amazon at the end, as it will most likely drive more sales towards them (good strategy).
	  						  <br>
	  						  Anyhow, a good gadget for the price. Maybe you even like the sponsored screen-savers, we believe they have good stuff planned for us.
	  						  <br>
	  						  <br>

  			Start doing things<strong> at the touch of a button</strong>...because we are too lazy to swipe and tap our  smartphone touchscreen anymore and we want to GO BACK TO BUTTONS :)
			<br><br>
			Flic is a wireless “smart button” that can connect to your phone to perform a wide variety of tasks. Each Flic can execute three actions by clicking,   double-clicking and yet another by holding. It comes with a reusable double-sided washable adhesive so you can stick it anywhere
  			  <br>
  			  <br>
			  
  	         Things that you can do with Flic: control lights, play music , take a picture, navigate , order pizza and much more. 
			 <br>One of the features we think is one of the most important.Flic lets you <strong>send a distress signal</strong>. E.g. send a text message to your friends with your location if you feel in danger without nobody realising it.
			   <br><br>
			Flic  team claims the <strong>battery will last up to five years</strong> and is a standard coin battery that can be replaced. 
			<br><br>
			I just wished they had it in red....I have big plans for the red button (diabolic laugh)

	  	          How much time do you spend in the morning trying to find your keys, phone , etc ? Most of us have that problem.

				   <br><br>
				   The bad...the battery only last about a year so you have to keep buying them, so  $25  a year to find your keys its a bit pricy.

	     	 Why are these cameras different? They capture "the entire light field – all the rays of light traveling in every direction through a scene – instead of a flat 2D image" so you don't need to pick a single focal point. You  can take a picture and you can leave to your friends to  interactively refocus and play with perspective shifting in your posts, which could be very cool addition to your blog.
	        			   <br><br>
	      			    You have to learn  how to get the best of this gadget. You can not trust what you have learn about taking pictures, in order to create those beautiful "living pictures" you have to see the light ;)... but if you are looking for new photography experiences and you have the money (it's price is one of its flaws) could definetly worth a try.

	   	   		  			</h4>
	   	   					<p>
	  		    Most of us use now multiple navigation apps in our phone to guide us when driving and, if you don't have a copilot, this phone holder for car air vent could be a good gadget for you .
	  			  <br>
	  			  <br>
			  
	  		With an easy one hand operation you can put your phone in any position you want, including portrait and landscape positions or anything in between which doesn't happen with other phone holders 
	  				<br><br>
	  				The design is good and will not interfere with the aesthetic of your car as it won't be visible once the phone is attached to it.
	  			   <br><br>
				    This might not be the best option for you, thought, as it will depend on where your air vents are situated and if you  get good and clear visibility from the driver sit. But if that is the case, and you have perfect vision....this is one of the best and simple options that we have seen.

		  We are still on the holidays season, so we wanted to show you something that helps make a bit easier the travel to your, I'm sure, gorgeous destination....or your camping trip.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
	 This travel jacket with built-in neck pillow, eye mask, gloves, drink pocket etc should help you. It comes in 4 Styles : Sweatshirt,  windbreaker,  bomber jacket or  blazer and it has pockets designed for tech, including spots for earbuds and a phone, but also for a tablet.

			<br><br>
			 Baubax is close to  the $5 million figure in kickstarter which is an incredible number for a clothing project (and for any kind of crowdfunding project). Yes, we know that is not strictly speaking "technology" but we believe could help store your gadgets on those long plain/train trips.
				 <br>
			 We hope when we store all our gadgets on the Baubax jacket, we can still walk and look cool ;)

		  			  <br>
		  		The wine purifier
		  			</h4>
					<p>
	  		  
	 "Üllo purifies any wine, restoring it to its natural state."
	  <br><br> 
	 There are a lot of people sensitive to sulfites but these preservatives are needed to  properly store it. Üllo claims to fix this problem and return the wine to its natural state, removing "sulfites, sediment, and second thoughts". 
			<br> <br>
  			This gadget has definetly caught our attention. For $60 if you are or you know somebody sensitive to sulfites, might be a good one to pre order before it gets more expensive. The basic order comes with 5 filters.
			The anticipated retail price for ten sulfite filters is $20 (Üllo is still determining the final filter specifications, but their research indicates that filters maintain efficacy for at least six months)
			<br><br>
			 We can't put price to enjoy a good wine without worries! We wish them the best of luck.

		  			  <br>
		  		Best pet ever!!
		  			</h4>
					<p>
	  		  
			  We believe Lily could be one of the fanciest and cutes drones for  sport and/or photography  passionate early adopters.<!-- and at a reasonable price.  -->
			  <br><br> 
			   Nobody needs to control it. It's simple, it follows you "throw and go!" 
		  		<br><br>
		  			 If this beauty does everything as shown in its promotional video above, it would be a really interesting drone.
		  			<br><br>
		  			Lily records video in full HD 1080p / 720p at 60fps (SloMo is 120 fps) and takes 12MP still photographs. Should fit in a backpack, is waterproof and can even land in water.
					<br> <br>
		  			The bad, only 20min battery life is a bit low :( but it  will be enough to record a nice round of skating, rafting or even all your movements on your soccer training (2h to recharge). The other one , it does not include obstacle avoidance, so it should be kept in open spaces.
					<br><br>
					Our team has already pre-ordered one. Hopefully we can do a full review soon.

		    <h4><strong>Sphero</strong></h4>
              <p>
				  Tired of dull toys for your kids? Sphero  is a next generation toy , kids can play with it and at the same time THEY LEARN!
				  <br>
				  A good mix of technology and robotics. You will be introducing your kids to science without even realizing it.
				  <br>
				  Furthermore Sphero can actually teach programming as it's itself programmable. We like it!!!
				  <br>
				  Less barbies more robots :)
