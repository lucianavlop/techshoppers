	 				We know Dji for its drones but today we are going to talk about the DJI Osmo camera. Dji has brought all their drones work in camera stabilisation down to the ground and into your hands
				
	 				<br><br>
		      	    Yes, there are better cameras, but we would struggle to get the quality of this  one at the same price. <strong>With until 4k video recording it is one to watch</strong>
				
					<br><br>
				
					An attachment allows you to connect your smartphone to it, which enables you to use it as a monitor to view a live image (via Wi-Fi) from the camera
					<br><br>
					The microphone seems to be the biggest flaw but depending of what use you are going to give to the camera, it might not bother you that much. With 6-hour standby time
					and 1 hour of video shooting, you might want to have an extra battery but apart from that, the accessories included seem pretty decent.
					<br><br>
					We like it!

			   			 <br><br>
			   	 	   	The 1byOne is a very cool turntable with an exquisite design. It is light enough and the handle makes it easy to carry so you can bring it to any party and it offers an ok sound for the price that we are talking about <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00XVJLYPW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00XVJLYPW&linkCode=as2&tag=yourtechshopp-21">€85</a>
			


			   			<br><br>
			   			With RCA and headphone jack outputs, you can enjoy the music of vinyl records at your own speaker system and headphones.  The best of this device is not the sound though, this is what we will call a turntable for beginners. <strong>This gadget focuses on its design  ;) it just looks great</strong>, plus if you haven't had a turntable before there is something about  letting that needle touch the vinyl that you can not find in any Hi-Fi system that everybody should experiment.
			   			<br> you might not be able to get a combination of design and sound for this price better than the 1ByOne that is why we think is a good present

	This new wearable Thermometer "<strong>monitors Body Temperature, Posture, and Motion</strong> of Your Loved Ones. All Day… All Night…" and we think it could be very useful in many cases.
	 <br>
	 <br>
	Its campaign focuses on the monitoring of babys and elderly people. This device not only alerts you when the temperature has passed an specific umbral, it tells you as well if the person is awake/asleep as monitors motion and position too, so you can go to sleep and relax knowing that <strong>Check-my-term will alert you if something goes wrong</strong>.
	<br><br>
	It  comes, obviously,with an app and allows you to share information with your doctor too. The app has a 'Record Symptoms' section where you can select symptoms from a menu and add additional notes to complete these reports. Check-My-Temp claims 30 days continuously monitoring without charging which is more of what we are used to... with wearables.
	<br><Br>
		A few more features of the app make this a very complete package for controlling temperature and more. It has achieve  its goal in Indiegogo and shipping is expected to begin this July.

 	Are you tired of charging your phone everyday or even every half day? It seems like the smartphones gave us a lot of new features but have gone backwards on the battery side of things.
 	<Br><br>
 	Oukitel tries to solve that problem and promises <strong>between 10 and 15 days of normal use without charging</strong>. The downsite of this is that with that battery you can't expect a light smartphone.
 		<br><br>
 		 If you are  a person that travels and does not want to be worried about charging the phone, this could be a phone that suits you, the other characteristics are ok and the price is not bad at all (€188)
 		<br> <br>
 		Another option for great battery is the already in preorder  the  <a href=http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_218002.html  target="_blank" >Ulefone Power </a> that you can find in Gearbest too which would last about <strong>4 days normal use </strong>and has even better specs in other areas.

	   	     	   <p>
	 We have talked before about the new Amazon Kindle family. Today we talk a bit more about the Kindle 7 inch that has erupted on the tablets low cost market. Here are the pros and cons of our time with the cheapest of the kindle family 

  
	  <br><br>
	<strong>The Pros</strong>: Price - It does well the basics - Strong - Premium members tailored operating systems

	  <br>
	 <strong> The Cons</strong>: Takes long time to charge - It won't be good enough for techies (neither other at this price) -  No HD - It doesn't have access to all of the Android apps in the Google Play Store - Amazon ads (to get rid of them £10) 

 
	  <br><br>
	    Overall <strong>for the price</strong> we think is a good gadget for people that will use it to browse the internet, emails or basic games.
		<br><br>
		Good present for parents non techies or kids that  won't need much from it. We have given one to one of our family members and she is delighted :)
		<br> <br>
		Any question about the performance of this gadget, you know you can ask us ;)

     	     	<h4><strong> Sennheiser CX 275s</strong>
     	   		 <br>
     	   			Universal Headset
     	   		</h4>
     	   <p>
 Sennheiser is one of the best sound quality brands that you can find and these earphones are at the level of a quality speaker system specifically designed for smartphones.
  
  <br><br>
  You don't only get powerfull earphones, you get as well a microphone and call pickup/cancel button that you can use in most smartphone/tables, not volume button though :( . The microphone is good and the person of the other end can hear you without any trouble.

  <br><br>
 The design is pretty basic following Senneheiser aesthetic and the ear tips (3 different sizes) are confortable and provide isolation to external sounds.
 
  <br><br>
   These earphones are bass driven, the bass is the focus, for bass lovers that want a integrated mic these are earphones to watch, if you are not that much into bass you might find that it misses other ranges of the spectrum but overall and for the budget we can recommend them

	  		  Xiaomi new MiBand is here and includes an optical heart monitor and all for approx. €30. 
		  
	  		  <br><br>
	  		  Xiaomi MiBand is one the most popular wearables in the world and this new version adds heart rate monitoring and the possibility to unlock the phone when approaching MiBand to it to its previous  sleep and step counter.
		   
	  		  <br><br>
	  		  The dimensions are a bit different than the previous model so you can not use the same accessories but they are cheap enough.
		 
	  		  <br><br>
	  		  Available to order  in Bestgear, unfortunately is not available from the European warehouse at the moment and has to be shipped from China so  it won't  arrive for  Christmas... still is a good one to have for our  new year resolution of doing more exercise ;)

	     	   <p>
	  		  This week another educational toy because we want to give for Christmas the perfect  gift that makes your kids the best inventors.
		  
	  		   <br><br>
		
	  		Makey Makey is trying to "help people start to think of themselves as Makers and agents of change. When you have the <em>Maker's Mindset</em>, you know you can change the world."
	  		  <br><br>
	  		Basically it works like a keyboard/mouse message each time that you touch an element connected to Makey Makey (18 Inputs, 12 Keyboard, 6 Mouse). The best part  is that you can use different objects to do these actions, which awakes your creativity. Any material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity should work E.g. Bananas, iron,  clay , lemons...
		  
	  		  <br><br>
	  		<strong> Have fun, think, invent and MAKE.</strong>The possibilities are endless!

	   	   			Cast your music to your Speakers
	   	   		</h4>
	   	   <p>
	   			This gadget solves a problem that  a lot of people have...and it's one of those that just works, simple and great!
	   			    <br><br>
	        	 	If you have a good soundsystem at home, you probably don't want to buy a cheap bad quality bluethooth speaker to just stream the songs  from your phone :)
	   		<br><br>
	   			 Chromecast allows you to stream music through your speakers without cables, and not only that , it makes it sound so much better that when you play it connecting you phone to your speaker via the jack or bluetooth. Chromecast plays the music from the cloud not from the device, so no matter how bad  your smartphone sound is...if you have good speakers, the music will still sound great on them.
	   			<br><br>
			
	   			When you Chromecast is connected you can still use your phone to get a phone call something that we couldn't do when we have our phone connected via the jack to our speakers. You can also allow casting from devices not signed into your Wi-Fi network via a PIN-based guest mode, to allow your guest choose the music and create great atmosphere for the best party ever :) !!
	   			<br><br>
	   		a few things that you have to consider:
		  
	   		  <br>
	   		  - You don't have to connect your phone/tablet  to your speaker with cables but you do have to plug the Chromecast into an outlet for power.
	   		    <br><br>
	   		    - It streams from the cloud so you can use it for soundcloud, spotify etc.. If you're using an app that doesn't have native Chromecast support, technically you can opt to mirror all of the audio coming out of your mobile device or your computer's Web browser and cast that to a speaker instead but we haven't tested this feature.
	   		  <br><br>
	   		  - At the moment you can not cast to multiple Chromecast audio but...this feature is coming!! and we are very excited about this. Full house sound system control at your fingertips with a few old hifi speakers.
	    <br><br>
	   		  It was exactly what we needed to make the house fully soooooound. We love it!

	   <p>
		Most of us like our fancy watches and change them depending of our outfit or event. The wearable industry is trying to convince us that the smart watches can be cool too...but the offer is not the same and in general smart watches lack a slick design.
		    <br><br>
   	      Chronos can be the solution as <strong>it brings the best of smart watches to our loved "dumb" watches</strong>.		
		 <br><br>
		With Chronos you can get <strong>smart notifications, fitness tracking and  control </strong>your phone's volume, music and camera through personalised taps and <strong>gestures</strong>.
		 <br><br>
		  Chronos specifications say the battery last 36 hours on full charge and it takes about 30 mins to charge. It measures under 3mm thin and 33mm in diameter so as per Chronos website it should fit on over 80% of watches sold today.
		<br><br>
	  Can our  watches get smarter? Yeeeeeeeeeeees

	  Chinese gadget Xiaomi is known for creating cheap but good products and MiScale is not exception.
	    <br><br>
	      MiScale is an elegant digital scale that shows your weight in pounds or kilos with its 161 LEDs display. 

	 <br><br>
	 so...why is it  smart? you can connect it with your smartphone ( app Mi Fit) and it will record your weight/BMI changes, actually not only yours, <strong>it can manage the weight of up to 16 people</strong> which recognises individually when they step on the scale...and 16 is probably enough for the whole family and neighbours  ;)
	 
	 <br><br>
	 It's powered by 4xAA batteries and works with  bluetooth 4.0,android and iOS (check compatibility), it can weight from 0.05 to 150kg and its white glass platform and style make it a scale that would look very good on the bathroom of any house.

     Hudway turns your smart phone into a head-up display at an affordable price.
	   <br><br>
	   Hudway has a number of apps that use your phone's GPS and accelerometer to show you data like location, driving speed and directions while you are driving. Plus, Hudway app doesn't visually overwhelm you with a lot of data. It is thought to keep you safe and don't distract you
	 <br><br>
	 There seems to be some limit on the display if you are directly facing the sun but in places like Ireland and UK that actually doesn't matter that much ;)

      There are better options out there but for the price we think this gadget is one that you should consider if you are looking for a new lamp desk.
	   <br><br>
	  <strong> The best:</strong> 3-Level lighting, High quality long lasting LEDs, night light mode and  1-hour auto-off timer saves on electricity.
	  
	<br>
	<strong>Not so good: </strong>It's basic, it has less light levels than other options of the same price range but it seems to be more reliable.

  						     		The new iMacs are in the stores now. And with them  retina 4K display for 21.5 macs :) at an "affordable" price.
  										5k retina display comes with all the 27 inches now and the new improved Magic mouse  2 and Magic Keyboard are the default option in all models. This new magic devices fully charged battery should last about a month and it looks like Apple has really though about comfort when designing them. 
  									<br><br>
  									Not so good: Fusion drive or flash storage are not the default option and can not be upgraded later, same as the RAM, so please make sure you get the adequate ones for you when configuring it, if you are thinking in buying one... You know you can always ask us for advice on these things ;).
  									<br>
  									The iMac 21,5 with 4k resolution got a 1 out of 10 (higher easier to repair..) in  <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iMac+Intel+21.5-Inch+Retina+4K+Display+Teardown/51098?">iFixit </a>, definitely not a good score. Basically it is difficult to repair so it will be expensive to do so.
  									<br><br>
  									Overall still one of the best one in all computers in the market in our opinion and the retina display make them even better.

						     			Rugby world cup is on and we wanted to show a gadget that could fit into this season....so we show you a ball. Yeah, we know it's actually an American football ball....but they are pretty similar ;), plus this is not only a ball, it is a speaker too!!
						   				<br><br>
									<strong>Nice features:</strong>  Waterproof and it floats. Beach friendly. glows-in-the-dark. It can be used as charger. Long bluetooth range. high impact (it has been tested with a drop from a several-story-up balcony  which it survived)
									 <br><br>
									It's a bit pricey but for beach lovers, party seekers and football/rugby fans might worth a try.
			
									<br><br>
									No much time left for its kickstarter campaign to finish and they are not close to their $75,000 target. So, if you are interested in this fun gadget. Back them  before is too late:)

	  						  <br>
	  			  			  <br>
	  						 <strong> The best: </strong>It contains the basics for a tablet, all compacted in a gadget supplied for a well respected brand.
	  						  <br>
	  						  <br>
	  						  <strong>The worst: </strong>It is Amazon content focused (which might be a good thing for Amazon lovers) and it contains sponsored screen-savers (to get rid of them  the price increases  £10 )
	  						  <br><br>
	  						 This is something that we don't like, if  they're going to include ads , they should give it to us for free ;). It makes more sense to us now why the price is so low. It will compensate Amazon at the end, as it will most likely drive more sales towards them (good strategy).
	  						  <br>
	  						  Anyhow, a good gadget for the price. Maybe you even like the sponsored screen-savers, we believe they have good stuff planned for us.

  			Start doing things<strong> at the touch of a button</strong>...because we are too lazy to swipe and tap our  smartphone touchscreen anymore and we want to GO BACK TO BUTTONS :)
			<br><br>
			Flic is a wireless “smart button” that can connect to your phone to perform a wide variety of tasks. Each Flic can execute three actions by clicking,   double-clicking and yet another by holding. It comes with a reusable double-sided washable adhesive so you can stick it anywhere
  			  <br>
  			  <br>
			  
  	         Things that you can do with Flic: control lights, play music , take a picture, navigate , order pizza and much more. 
			 <br>One of the features we think is one of the most important.Flic lets you <strong>send a distress signal</strong>. E.g. send a text message to your friends with your location if you feel in danger without nobody realising it.
			   <br><br>
			Flic  team claims the <strong>battery will last up to five years</strong> and is a standard coin battery that can be replaced. 
			<br><br>
			I just wished they had it in red....I have big plans for the red button (diabolic laugh)

	  	          How much time do you spend in the morning trying to find your keys, phone , etc ? Most of us have that problem.
				   You can attach Tiles to almost any object and find it in seconds. If your Tile is within the 100-foot Bluetooth range, it will play a loud tune.
				   <br><br>
				   The bad...the battery only last about a year so you have to keep buying them, so  $25  a year to find your keys its a bit pricy.

		   	   		  		New Photography Experiences
		   	   		  			</h4>
		   	   					<p>
	     	 Why are these cameras different? They capture "the entire light field – all the rays of light traveling in every direction through a scene – instead of a flat 2D image" so you don't need to pick a single focal point. You  can take a picture and you can leave to your friends to  interactively refocus and play with perspective shifting in your posts, which could be very cool addition to your blog.
	        			   <br><br>
	      			    You have to learn  how to get the best of this gadget. You can not trust what you have learn about taking pictures, in order to create those beautiful "living pictures" you have to see the light ;)... but if you are looking for new photography experiences and you have the money (it's price is one of its flaws) could definetly worth a try.

	   	   		  			</h4>
	   	   					<p>
	  		    Most of us use now multiple navigation apps in our phone to guide us when driving and, if you don't have a copilot, this phone holder for car air vent could be a good gadget for you .
	  			  <br>
	  			  <br>
			  
	  		With an easy one hand operation you can put your phone in any position you want, including portrait and landscape positions or anything in between which doesn't happen with other phone holders 
	  				<br><br>
	  				The design is good and will not interfere with the aesthetic of your car as it won't be visible once the phone is attached to it.
	  			   <br><br>
				    This might not be the best option for you, thought, as it will depend on where your air vents are situated and if you  get good and clear visibility from the driver sit. But if that is the case, and you have perfect vision....this is one of the best and simple options that we have seen.

		  We are still on the holidays season, so we wanted to show you something that helps make a bit easier the travel to your, I'm sure, gorgeous destination....or your camping trip.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  
	 This travel jacket with built-in neck pillow, eye mask, gloves, drink pocket etc should help you. It comes in 4 Styles : Sweatshirt,  windbreaker,  bomber jacket or  blazer and it has pockets designed for tech, including spots for earbuds and a phone, but also for a tablet.

			<br><br>
			 Baubax is close to  the $5 million figure in kickstarter which is an incredible number for a clothing project (and for any kind of crowdfunding project). Yes, we know that is not strictly speaking "technology" but we believe could help store your gadgets on those long plain/train trips.
				 <br>
			 We hope when we store all our gadgets on the Baubax jacket, we can still walk and look cool ;)

		  			  <br>
		  		The wine purifier
		  			</h4>
					<p>
	  		  
	 "Üllo purifies any wine, restoring it to its natural state."
	  <br><br> 
	 There are a lot of people sensitive to sulfites but these preservatives are needed to  properly store it. Üllo claims to fix this problem and return the wine to its natural state, removing "sulfites, sediment, and second thoughts". 
			<br> <br>
  			This gadget has definetly caught our attention. For $60 if you are or you know somebody sensitive to sulfites, might be a good one to pre order before it gets more expensive. The basic order comes with 5 filters.
			The anticipated retail price for ten sulfite filters is $20 (Üllo is still determining the final filter specifications, but their research indicates that filters maintain efficacy for at least six months)
			<br><br>
			 We can't put price to enjoy a good wine without worries! We wish them the best of luck.

		  			  <br>
		  		Best pet ever!!
		  			</h4>
					<p>
	  		  
			  We believe Lily could be one of the fanciest and cutes drones for  sport and/or photography  passionate early adopters.<!-- and at a reasonable price.  -->
			  <br><br> 
			   Nobody needs to control it. It's simple, it follows you "throw and go!" 
		  		<br><br>
		  			 If this beauty does everything as shown in its promotional video above, it would be a really interesting drone.
		  			<br><br>
		  			Lily records video in full HD 1080p / 720p at 60fps (SloMo is 120 fps) and takes 12MP still photographs. Should fit in a backpack, is waterproof and can even land in water.
					<br> <br>
		  			The bad, only 20min battery life is a bit low :( but it  will be enough to record a nice round of skating, rafting or even all your movements on your soccer training (2h to recharge). The other one , it does not include obstacle avoidance, so it should be kept in open spaces.
					<br><br>
					Our team has already pre-ordered one. Hopefully we can do a full review soon.

              <p>
				  Tired of dull toys for your kids? Sphero  is a next generation toy , kids can play with it and at the same time THEY LEARN!
				  <br>
				  A good mix of technology and robotics. You will be introducing your kids to science without even realizing it.
				  <br>
				  Furthermore Sphero can actually teach programming as it's itself programmable. We like it!!!
				  <br>
				  Less barbies more robots :)
