	  <div class="twelve columns">
	  		 	 <p >   
			   		  We have the Redmi Note 3 pro for the las 3 weeks and this is what we think about it.
						
	   				
				<br><br>
				<strong>Pros</strong>
			
				<br>
			- Design: We love it! is ergonomic, thin and light (well...light for the size of the battery). We thought the champagne colour will be a bit tacky but now that we have it on our hands.<strong>It looks great!!</strong><br>
			- Usability: It is just easy to use, there are a few things that we don't like about <strong>Xiaomi MIUI system</strong>, but overall great users experience and has many cool extras already installed. The <strong>fingerprint sensor </strong>works perfectly and is very handy to seemly unlock the phone.<br>
			- Screen: It's just amazing! Inside of the house or outside, for movies or gaming...You could compare it with mobiles much more expensive and this would be better. Plus has fallen a few times and no scratches at all!<br>
			- Price: It would be difficult to find a more complete phone for this price

			<br><br>
			<strong>Cons</strong>
			<br>
			- Camera. The camera is not bad. Actually is pretty good, except on low light where it is just not good enough. Panoramic mode is useless too as it changes the resolution and looses all the detail. The front camera for selfies is pretty good, so overall a so so camera<br>
			- The build: The build is very good and its metallic cover will last long, but the golden ribbon of the screen is made of plastic/cardboard so if it falls without a cover, that little ribbon will get damage and look pretty bad.
			<br><br>
			<strong>The rest</strong>
			<br>
			Battery is ok , it last up to 3 days but for heavy use will last about a day. It has quick charge so with 5 minutes you get half day.
			<br>
			Sound is good too no complaints.
			<br>
			Connectivity is good too , no problems with 3G, 4G, bluetooth, WIFI or GPS 
			<br>
			<strong>Does not have USB-C or NFC</strong> which would be nice to have but overall a very good terminal for the price.
			<br><br>
